# python-string-handling
       This program can be used for string handling instead of upper(),lower(),capitalize() and title() methods. It does the same thing without using this methods.

   I selected to make this program to understand the Mathematics behind string functions.
This program make changes with using Unicode values of the characters in given string.
   Basically, I used Unicode values of 'a' , 'z' , 'A' and 'Z' to convert an uppercase character to lowercase character  or to convert a lowercase character to uppercase character.
These are 4 Unicode values I used:
The symbol for the letter A is represented by character number 65.
The symbol for the letter Z is represented by character number 90.
The symbol for the letter a is represented by character number 97.
The symbol for the letter z is represented by character number 122.

My program use these steps:
      It gives an output which explains the purpose of the program then asks the user for a string input. 
     Then, it finds out how long the string is and gives an information output.
     Then, it creates a new string for to store the modifications.
      Then, it gives an output which shows the options then asks the user for a input which sould be 1 ,2,3 or 4. 
       Option 1 is for Uppercase all letters of the string. It does the same thing as  upper() method.
       Option 2 is for Lowercase all letters of the string. It does the same thing as  lower() method.
      Option 3 is for Uppercase the first letter and lowercase all remaining letters of the string. It does the same thing as  capitalize() method.
      Option 4 is for Uppercase the first letter and lowercase all remaining letters of each word in the string. It does the same thing as  title() method.
       According to given input, it does what user wants and gives an output which shows the new string after processing.
